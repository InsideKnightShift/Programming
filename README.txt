This archive contains most of the development tools for Knightshift / Knightshift 2 and some sample 3d content. I guess you may use the 3d content for modding & reverse engineering purposes but for nothing else.

# EditorDef

- This configures how objects are grouped and displayed in the game's level editor. New objects must be added there to be shown in the editor.

# KS ParametersTool / KS Parameters

# KnightC

- Pretty similar to EarthC.

# LangEdit

- This is for creating dialogs and other in-game text.

# 3DS Max Plugin

- "3DSMAX GamePlugin51" is the mesh/scene export plugin that works with 3DS Max 5, whereas the other version only works with 3DS Max 4.1. 
- Copy the files to the "plugins" folder of 3DS Max 5. Inside 3DS Max, the plugin is called "Export to AOD file". 
- Checkout the provided documentation and sample files to figure out how to create valid objects.
- Refer to the sheet "AnimationParams" in the Excel parameters file to see what types of character animations there are.


# Particle Editor

- There was a particle effect editor called "ParticleGen" provided by Reality Pump, which is missing here. They later tried to sell what became of that editor as a standalone product (see here: https://www.crystalpictures.eu/particlegen/en/?downloads).
